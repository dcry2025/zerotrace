	"body": "<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8\">At zerotrace, privacy is our top priority. This service is built to ensure maximum security and anonymity for sharing sensitive information. This policy outlines the comprehensive measures taken by zerotrace to protect your privacy.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">1. Service description</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">zerotrace is a free web‑based service for creating encrypted notes that can be shared as unique one‑time HTTPS links. By default, notes are deleted after the first access.</p>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\">Sending the link happens outside zerotrace and remains the user’s responsibility.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">2. How the notes and contents are processed</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\"><strong>End‑to‑End Encryption:</strong> Notes are encrypted in your browser before sending. The key is stored in the URL fragment (after #) and never reaches our servers.</p>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\"><strong>Zero‑Knowledge:</strong> We don’t possess the key and cannot decrypt stored notes.</p>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\"><strong>Read‑once:</strong> After the first read, the note is deleted immediately and permanently.</p>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\"><strong>Custom expiration:</strong> You can set a lifetime; until then, the note remains only in encrypted form.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">3. IP addresses and logs</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\"><strong>No IP logs:</strong> We do not log IP addresses; only minimal operational logs without personal data are kept.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">4. User data and anonymity</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\"><strong>No accounts:</strong> Registration is not required.</p>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\"><strong>Telegram integration:</strong> When enabled, the note is linked via our bot after creation. We send a one‑time notification on the first access. <strong>Emergency alerts</strong> may be sent if someone enters a wrong password or attempts to re‑activate an already linked note; from that alert you can remotely <strong>DELETE</strong> the note.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">5. Password protection</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\">Passwords are optional and stored as secure hashes. Multiple wrong attempts may lead to automatic deletion; with Telegram alerts enabled you’ll be notified.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">6. Third‑party services</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\"><strong>Telegram Bot API</strong> is used solely to deliver the notifications mentioned above.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">7. Cookies and localStorage</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\">Only essential cookies/localStorage are used (session, crypto process, UI preferences). No analytics or tracking.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">8. Data retention and deletion</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\">Read‑once deletion by default; unread notes removed within 30 days; no backups.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">9. Open source and transparency</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\">We value transparency. While we don’t disclose algorithm details for security reasons, we follow industry best practices for end‑to‑end encryption and zero‑knowledge design.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">10. Children’s privacy</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\">We do not knowingly collect information from children under 16; the service targets a general audience. Minors should obtain parental/guardian consent.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">11. Changes to this policy</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\">We may update this policy. All changes will be published on this page with an updated “Last modified” date.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">12. Contact</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\">For privacy or security inquiries, contact us via Telegram; links are available in the site footer.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">13. Disclaimer</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\">zerotrace provides encryption infrastructure and secure storage; however, it is not responsible for the content of notes created by users. Users are solely responsible for the content they publish.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4\">14. Contact information</h2>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\">If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, security concerns, or feedback about zerotrace, please see the contact card below.</p>",
